### Overview

I picked to build a simple calculator app to demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript. This application uses a variety of arrays, loops, objects, functions and event handlers to perform the functionality of your typical calculator. If you try to break the app (NaN or Infinity), you will get an error message which is good for user experience. I encourage you to also view the source code via my Github to gain further insight of the functionality.

### Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

### Challenges

The biggest challenge for this project was to resist looking up tutorials online on how to specifically build a calculator. Since this was one of my first JavaScript projects, I wanted to force myself to think like a programmer and look up documentation on specific concepts rather than have everything explained in a video that ultimately I would learn less from.

### Solution

As the project progressed I learned how to properly search for resources needed via MDN or Stack Overflow to solve key issues. One of the biggest issues I resolve was creating a validation function where decimals could only be inputted once from the user.

### Key Features

- Error handling for NaN or Infinity
- Read-Only inputs to prevent mobile keyboards
