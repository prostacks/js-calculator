# js-calculator

I picked to build a simple calculator app to demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript. This application uses a variety of arrays, loops, objects, functions and event handlers to perform the functionality of your typical calculator. If you try to break the app (NaN or Infinity), you will get an error message which is good for user experience. I encourage you to also view the source code via my Github to gain further insight of the functionality.
